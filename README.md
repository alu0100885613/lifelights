Color your RGB bulbs based on in-game health bars. Currently works out of the box with Heroes of the Storm, but can be made to fit any game!

Attempt to detect a health bar in game, and measure the width of the rectangle to get current status

As your health (or mana, or anything) gets smaller, the invisible rectangle gets smaller.
